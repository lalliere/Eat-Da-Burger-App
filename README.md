# Eat Da Burger App

## Project Description
### Hungry??

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- <i>waiting to be devoured.</i>

Each burger in the waiting area also has a "Devour it!" button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page -- <i>list of Burger Battles won.</i>
